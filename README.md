# KafOpticon

Kafka Cluster Monitor and Visualizer

# About the Project

**What:** KafOpticon is an open-source electron app used for monitoring,
visualizing, and alerting users of Kafka cluster/server metrics. Kafka is a
powerful open-source data stream processing software platform. KafOpticon
article can be found
[here](https://medium.com/@gosoriocanales/monitor-and-visualize-your-kafka-clusters-with-kafopticon-3a08b1db822d).

**Why:** Monitoring relevant cluster metrics is challenging due to the volume
and accessibility of the metrics. KafOpticon aims to solve these problems by
providing REAL-TIME monitoring, visualization, and alert features.

# Installation

To install as an app, navigate to the releases page of our repository, find the
file that matches your OS, and download it.

Additionally, you could clone this repository, run `npm install` and then
`npm start` to run the app from source code.

It is also possible to clone the repository, checkout into the electron-builder
branch that matches your OS, and execute `npm run dist`. The app will be in the
out/ folder at the repository's root.

## Using KafOpticon with Docker-mediated Prometheus and Grafana

KafOpticon is specially designed for ease of monitoring Kafka clusters. It
automatically generates Prometheus and Grafana containers in Docker, which
connect to the metrics endpoints you provide. This setup uses JMX Exporter's
JMX-Prometheus Java Agent to scrape metric endpoints from each Kafka cluster.

### Configuration Steps:

1. **Set Up Your Kafka Cluster for Monitoring:**

   - For configuring your own Kafka cluster to be monitored using KafOpticon,
     ensure that your Kafka cluster exposes Prometheus-readable metrics data.
     This is crucial for KafOpticon‚Äôs Prometheus container to connect
     effectively.
   - For more information on setting up JMX Exporter, visit the
     [JMX Exporter GitHub page](https://github.com/prometheus/jmx_exporter).

2. **Connect KafOpticon to Your Cluster:**
   - Open the KafOpticon app.
   - Provide a comma-separated list of the exposed JMX Endpoints of your Kafka
     cluster (e.g. 9991, 9992, 9993).
   - Click on the ‚Äúsend to Docker monitoring‚Äù checkbox and hit send.

### Monitoring with Docker Desktop:

- After setting up, monitor the process in Docker Desktop. Prometheus and
  Grafana containers will be built for monitoring your cluster.
- Allow KafOpticon some time to refresh as these containers are built and
  monitoring information is sent to the app.
- If the dashboard is not displaying as expected, press `Command+R` (or `Ctrl+R`
  on Windows) to refresh the page.
- Regularly check Docker Desktop to ensure the Prometheus and Grafana containers
  are running as expected. Restart any containers that have exited to
  troubleshoot potential issues.

## Run Docker Test

If you want to test the app, but you don't have your own Kafka cluster, follow
the directions below.

1. Preconditions:

   - Docker Desktop must be installed and the Docker daemon must be running.
   - Ports 3000, 3010, 9090, 9991, 9992, and 9993 must be available.

2. Run Kafka Test Cluster in Docker:

   - Navigate to the `docker-test` directory and run `docker-compose up -d` to
     start a Kafka cluster in Docker with three brokers, each exposing metrics
     on ports 9991, 9992,and 9993, respectively. Ensure the container is running
     without issues in Docker Desktop. Restart any exited containers if
     necessary.

   ```javascript
   docker-compose up -d

   ```

3. Run Electron:

- Run electron with `npm start` in the root directory.

```javascript
npm start
```

4. Start Monitoring:

- Provide a comma-separated list of the exposed JMX Endpoints of your Kafka
  cluster (9991, 9992, 9993 if using the provided docker-compose file), check
  the ‚Äúsend to Docker monitoring checkbox‚Äù, and hit send. Monitor the setup in
  Docker Desktop and refresh the app as needed using `COMMAND+R`.

5. Stop Docker Test:

- Stop the prometheus and grafana containers, and run `docker-compose down`
  within the docker-test directory.

```javascript
docker-compose down
```

## Run local test

1. Preconditions:

   - Prometheus and Grafana must be installed
   - Ensure that Prometheus and Kafka are in your `$PATH`
   - Grafana must be running already (on port 3000) and must be configured to
     allow anonymous access with the admin role in the Main Org.
   - Ports 3010, 9090, 3030, and 9092 must be available

2. Open up two terminals in the root directory.
3. Run `npm run bootZoo` and `npm run bootKaf1` in the separate terminals.

```javascript
npm run bootZoo
```

```javascript
npm run bootKaf1
```

4. Open up a terminal in the root directory. Run `npm start` in the root
   directory

```javascript
npm start
```

5. In the electron app, type 'localhost:2020' into the form, check 'send to
   local monitoring' and submit it. Wait. Refresh if necessary. Click into
   performance or health metrics. Data on the kafka cluster should be displayed.

## Customization

KafOpticon offers flexible customization options for both locally mediated and
Docker-mediated testing environments.

### Customizing Monitoring Dashboard:

- **Pre-configured Panels:** You can configure an additional monitoring tab with
  up to 10 panels of pre-selected metrics.
- **Grafana Dashboard Customization:**
  1.  Navigate to `localhost:3000` in your browser.
  2.  Click into `Dashboards`, and locate a dashboard titled _KafOpticon
      Dashboard_.
  3.  Use the features of Grafana to customize your dashboard to your
      preference.

### Making Customizations Persistent:

- **Saving Changes in Grafana:**

  - After making your desired changes, save them within Grafana.
  - Export the dashboard JSON that Grafana provides.

- **Updating the Source Code:**
  - If you are running KafOpticon from the source code, navigate to
    `grafana/Dockerfile/provisioning/dashboards`.
  - Replace the existing `dashboard.json` with your new one and save the
    changes.
  - Currently, this will only work if you choose to use KafOpticon's Docker
    route to monitor your clusters.

By following these steps, you can tailor the KafOpticon monitoring experience to
better suit your specific needs and preferences.

# Alerts

In order to enable automatic alerts an email and app password are required. The
easiest way to do this is to provide a gmail username and an app password in the
relevant fields of the alerts dashboard. After clicking the submit button, you
must restart Grafana for the changes to take place. After Grafana has been
restarted, you are now free to add any emails you want to receive the alerts in
the Grafana alerts contact points. You can send test email using the test
button. Configure and customize threshholds for the alerts within Grafana.
Congratulations! üèÜÔ∏è You should now be able to receive automatic email alerts
about your Kafka clusters.

# Road Map

Check out [issues](https://github.com/oslabs-beta/KafOpticon/issues) for further
information about possible new features

1. Solve bugs associated with sending form data to the docker route on linux.
2. Work on local route.

- Dynamically boot up Prometheus jmxExporter http server in production; in
  development, tear them down properly,
- Enable connecting to more than one kafka broker.

3. Expand the user's ability to configure the dashboard and have it persist.
4. Increase testing coverage.
5. Create Windows distribution.
